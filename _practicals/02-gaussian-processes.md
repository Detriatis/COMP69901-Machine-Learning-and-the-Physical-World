	This practical works through the material that is covered in the second week of the module. In this lab-sheet we introduce Gaussian processes as priors over the space of functions. The important concepts is the introduction of non-parametric methods where we instead of describing the parameters of the function we directly describe the output of the function. We will implement Gaussian processes for a regression task and it is important that you see that the methodology follows directly from how we did linear regression in the previous work-sheet. After you had done the lab take a look at the previous weeks work-sheet and see hopefully you can see how similar the equations are.
