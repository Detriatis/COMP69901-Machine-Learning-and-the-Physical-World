    "## Types of Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve introduced simulations from the perspective of laws of physics. In\n",
    "practice, many simulations may not directly encode for the laws of\n",
    "physics, but they might encode expert intuitions about a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Formula 1 races, the cars have tyres that wear at\n",
    "different rates. Softer tyres allow the cars to drive faster but wear\n",
    "quicker. Harder tyres man the car drives slower but they last longer.\n",
    "Changing between tyres is part of the race, and it has a time penalty.\n",
    "Before each race the teams decide what their strategy will be with tyre\n",
    "changes. It’s not only how many tyre changes that are important, but\n",
    "when they happen. If you change your tyre early, you might get a speed\n",
    "advantage and be able to pass your rival when they change their tyre\n",
    "later. This is a trick known as ‘undercutting’, but if your early change\n",
    "puts you back onto the track behind other slower cars, you will lose\n",
    "this advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula 1 teams determine their strategy through simulating the race.\n",
    "Each team knows how fast other teams are around the track, and what\n",
    "their top speeds are. So, the teams simulate many thousands or millions\n",
    "of races with different strategies for their rivals, and they choose the\n",
    "strategy for which they maximize their number of expected points.\n",
    "\n",
    "When many simulations are done, the results take time to come. During\n",
    "the actual race, the simulations are too slow to provide the real time\n",
    "information teams would need. In this case F1 teams can use emulators,\n",
    "models that have learnt the effect of the simulations, to give real time\n",
    "updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula 1 race simulations contain assumptions that derive from physics\n",
    "but don’t directly encode the physical laws. For example, if one car is\n",
    "stuck behind another, in any given lap, it might overtake. A typical\n",
    "race simulation will look at the lap speed of each car and the top speed\n",
    "of each car (as measured in ‘speed traps’ that are placed on the\n",
    "straight). It will assume a probability of overtake for each lap that is\n",
    "a function of these values. Of course, underlying that function is the\n",
    "physics of how cars overtake each other, but that can be abstracted away\n",
    "into a simpler function that the Race Strategy Engineer defines from\n",
    "their knowledge and previous experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many simulations have this characteristic: major parts of the simulation\n",
    "are the result of encoding expert knowledge in the code. But this can\n",
    "lead to challenges. I once asked a strategy engineer, who had completed\n",
    "a new simulation, how it was going. He replied that things had started\n",
    "out well, but over time its performance was degrading. We discussed this\n",
    "for a while and over time a challenge of mis-specified granularity\n",
    "emerged."

    "## Fidelity of the Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineer explained how there’d been a race where the simulation had\n",
    "suggested that their main driver *shouldn’t* pit because he would have\n",
    "emerged behind a car with a slower lap speed, but a high top-speed. This\n",
    "would have made that car difficult to overtake. However, the driver of\n",
    "that slower car was also in the team’s ‘development program’, so\n",
    "everyone in the team knew that the slower car would have moved aside to\n",
    "let their driver through. Unfortunately, the simulation didn’t know\n",
    "this. So, the team felt the wrong stategy decision was made. After the\n",
    "race, the simulation was updated to include a special case for this\n",
    "situation. The new code checked whether the slower car was a development\n",
    "driver, making it ‘more realistic’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time there were a number of similar changes, each of which should\n",
    "have improved the simulation, but the reality was the code was now\n",
    "‘mixing granularities’. The formula for computing the probability of\n",
    "overtake as a function of speeds is one that is relatively easy to\n",
    "verify. It ignores the relationships between drivers, whether a given\n",
    "driver is a development driver, whether one bears a grudge or not,\n",
    "whether one is fighting for their place in the team. That’s all\n",
    "assimilated into the equation. The original equation is easy to\n",
    "calibrate, but as soon as you move to a finer granularity and consider\n",
    "more details about individual drivers, the model seems more realistic,\n",
    "but it becomes difficult to specify, and therefore performance degrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations work at different fidelities, but as the Formula 1 example\n",
    "shows you must be very careful about mixing fidelities within the same\n",
    "simulation. The appropriate fidelity of a simulation is strongly\n",
    "dependent on the question being asked of it. On the context. For\n",
    "example, in Formula 1 races you can also simulate the performance of the\n",
    "car in the wind tunnel and using computational fluid dynamics\n",
    "representations of the Navier-Stokes equations. That level of fidelity\n",
    "*is* appropriate when designing the aerodynamic components of the car,\n",

    "\n",
    "Within any simulation, we can roughly split the variables of interest\n",
    "into the state variables and the parameters. In the Herd immunity\n",
    "example, the state variables were the different susceptible, exposed,\n",
    "infectious and recovered groups. The parameters were the reproduction\n",
    "number and the expected lengths of infection and the timing of lockdown.\n",
    "Often parameters are viewed as the inputs to the simulation, the things\n",
    "we can control. We might want to know how to time lock down to minimize\n",
    "the number of deaths. This behavior of the simulator is what we may want\n",
    "to emulate with our Gaussian process model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve introduced simulation motivated by the physical laws of\n",
    "the universe. Those laws are sometimes encoded in differential\n",
    "equations, in which case we can try to solve those systems (like with\n",
    "Herd Immunity or Navier Stokes). An alternative approach is taken in the\n",
    "Game of Life. There a turn-based simulation is used, at each turn, we\n",
    "iterate through the simulation updating the state of the simulation.\n",
    "This is known as a *discrete event simulation*. In race simulation for\n",
    "Formula 1 a discrete event simulation is also used. There is another\n",
    "form of discrete event simulation, often used in chemical models, where\n",
    "the events don’t take place at regular intervals. Instead, the timing to\n",
    "the next event is computed, and the simulator advances that amount of\n",
    "time. For an example of this see [the Gillespie\n",
    "algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a third type of simulation that we’d also like to introduce.\n",
    "That is simulation within computer software. In particular, the need to\n",
    "backtest software with ‘what if’ ideas, or to trace errors that may have\n",
    "occurred in production. This can involve loading up entire code bases\n",
    "and rerunning them with simulated inputs. This is a third form of\n",
    "simulation where emulation can also come in useful."

    "example, in Formula 1 you need to worry about next year’s car. So, while\n",
    "you’re working on updating this year’s car, you also need to think about\n",
    "what will happen for next year and prioritize these conflicting needs\n",

    "Those decisions are being made on short time schedules; purchases are\n",

    "> question is actually the more important of the two – because you can\n",

    "> \\[I\\]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices,\n",
    "> and I know that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast\n",
    "> delivery; they want vast selection. It’s impossible to imagine a\n",
    "> future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, ‘Jeff I\n",
    "> love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,’ \\[or\\] ‘I\n",
    "> love Amazon; I just wish you’d deliver a little more slowly.’\n",
    "> Impossible. And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those\n",
    "> things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be\n",
    "> paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you\n",
    "> have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can\n",
    "> afford to put a lot of energy into it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This quote is incredibly important for long term thinking. Indeed, it’s\n",
    "a failure of many of our simulations that they focus on what is going to\n",
    "happen, not what will not happen. In Amazon, this meant that there was\n",
    "constant focus on these three areas, keeping costs low, making delivery\n",
    "fast and improving selection. For example, shortly before I left Amazon\n",
    "moved its entire US network from two-day delivery to one-day delivery.\n",

    "<!--These challenges are not just there for Amazon and Formula 1. In Sheffield, we worked closely with a Chesterfield based company called Fusion Group. They make joints that fuse PTFE pipes together. These pipes are used for transporting both water and gas. Their founder, Eric Bridgstock, was an engineer who introduced PTFE piping to the UK when working for DuPont. Eric set up Fusion group to manufacture the fusion fittings. Because PTFE pipes carry water or gas at high pressure, when these fittings fail significant damage can occur. When these fittings were originally installed in the early 1980s, the job was done by a specialist, but nowadays the pipe weld is compelted by the same team that digs the hole. While costs have come down, the number of PTFE weld failures went up. Eric's company focussed on new systems for auto-->\n",

    "*random sampling*, *stratified sampling* and *Latin hypercube sampling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let the input values $\\mathbf{ x}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{ x}_n$ be a random\n",
    "> sample from $f(\\mathbf{ x})$. This method of sampling is perhaps the\n",
    "> most obvious, and an entire body of statistical literature may be used\n",
    "> in making inferences regarding the distribution of $Y(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using stratified sampling, all areas of the sample space of\n",
    "> $\\mathbf{ x}$ are represented by input values. Let the sample space\n",
    "> $S$ of $\\mathbf{ x}$ be partitioned into $I$ disjoint strata $S_t$.\n",
    "> Let $\\pi = P(\\mathbf{ x}\\in S_i)$ represent the size of $S_i$. Obtain\n",
    "> a random sample $\\mathbf{ x}_{ij}$, $j = 1, \\dots, n$ from $S_i$. Then\n",
    "> of course the $n_i$ sum to $n$. If $I = 1$, we have random sampling\n",
    "> over the entire sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The same reasoning that led to stratified sampling, ensuring that all\n",
    "> portions of $S$ were sampled, could lead further. If we wish to ensure\n",
    "> also that each of the input variables $\\mathbf{ x}_k$ has all portions\n",
    "> of its distribution represented by input values, we can divide the\n",
    "> range of each $\\mathbf{ x}_k$ into $n$ strata of equal marginal\n",
    "> probability $1/n$, and sample once from each stratum. Let this sample\n",
    "> be $\\mathbf{ x}_{kj}$, $j = 1, \\dots, n$. These form the\n",
    "> $\\mathbf{ x}_k$ component, $k = 1, \\dots , K$, in $\\mathbf{ x}_i$,\n",
    "> $i = 1, \\dots, n$. The components of the various $\\mathbf{ x}_k$’s are\n",
    "> matched at random. This method of selecting input values is an\n",
    "> extension of quota sampling (Steinberg 1963), and can be viewed as a\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We summarized the different types of simulation into roughly three\n",
    "groups. Firstly, those based on physical laws in the form of\n",
    "differential equations. Examples include certain compartmental\n",
    "epidemiological models, climate models and weather models. Secondly,\n",
    "discrete event simulations. These simulations often run to a ‘clock’,\n",
    "where updates to the state are taken in turns. The Game of Life is an\n",
    "example of this type of simulation, and Formula 1 models of race\n",
    "strategy also use this approach. There is another type of discrete event\n",
    "simulation that doesn’t use a turn-based approach but waits for the next\n",
    "event. The [Gillespie\n",
    "algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) is an\n",
    "example of such an approach but we didn’t cover it here. Finally, we\n",
    "realized that general computer code bases are also simulations. If a\n",
    "company has a large body of code, and particularly if it’s hosted within\n",
    "a streaming environment (such as Apache Kafka), it’s possible to back\n",
    "test the code with different inputs. Such backtests can be viewed as\n",
    "simulations, and in the case of large bodies of code (such as the code\n",
    "that manages Amazon’s automated buying systems) the back tests can be\n",
    "slow and could also benefit from emulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve introduced emulation as a way of dealing with different fidelities\n",
    "of simulations and removing the computational demands that come with\n",
    "them. We’ve highlighted how emulation can be deployed and introduced the\n",
    "`GPy` software for Gaussian process modelling."
