    "race simulation will look at the lap speed of each car and the top speed\n",
    "of each car (as measured in ‘speed traps’ that are placed on the\n",
    "straight). It will assume a probability of overtake for each lap that is\n",
    "a function of these values. Of course, underlying that function is the\n",
    "physics of how cars overtake each other, but that can be abstracted away\n",
    "into a simpler function that the Race Strategy Engineer defines from\n",
    "their knowledge and previous experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many simulations have this characteristic: major parts of the simulation\n",
    "are the result of encoding expert knowledge in the code. But this can\n",

    "a new simulation, how it was going. He replied that things had started\n",

    "for a while and over time a challenge of mis-specified granularity\n",

    "would have made that car difficult to overtake. However, the driver of\n",
    "that slower car was also in the team’s ‘development program’, so\n",
    "everyone in the team knew that the slower car would have moved aside to\n",
    "let their driver through. Unfortunately, the simulation didn’t know\n",
    "this. So, the team felt the wrong stategy decision was made. After the\n",
    "race, the simulation was updated to include a special case for this\n",
    "situation. The new code checked whether the slower car was a development\n",

    "Over time there were a number of similar changes, each of which should\n",
    "have improved the simulation, but the reality was the code was now\n",
    "‘mixing granularities’. The formula for computing the probability of\n",
    "overtake as a function of speeds is one that is relatively easy to\n",
    "verify. It ignores the relationships between drivers, whether a given\n",
    "driver is a development driver, whether one bears a grudge or not,\n",
    "whether one is fighting for their place in the team. That’s all\n",

    "example, in Formula 1 races you can also simulate the performance of the\n",
    "car in the wind tunnel and using computational fluid dynamics\n",

    "The same team also uses highly detailed aerodynamics simulations with\n",
    "computational fluid dynamics for car design. This different fidelity is\n",

    "Within any simulation, we can roughly split the variables of interest\n",

    "example, the state variables were the different susceptible, exposed,\n",
    "infectious and recovered groups. The parameters were the reproduction\n",
    "number and the expected lengths of infection and the timing of lockdown.\n",
    "Often parameters are viewed as the inputs to the simulation, the things\n",
    "we can control. We might want to know how to time lock down to minimize\n",

    "Herd Immunity or Navier Stokes). An alternative approach is taken in the\n",
    "Game of Life. There a turn-based simulation is used, at each turn, we\n",
    "iterate through the simulation updating the state of the simulation.\n",
    "This is known as a *discrete event simulation*. In race simulation for\n",
    "Formula 1 a discrete event simulation is also used. There is another\n",
    "form of discrete event simulation, often used in chemical models, where\n",
    "the events don’t take place at regular intervals. Instead, the timing to\n",

    "their strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, businesses must also think about more medium-term horizons. For\n",
    "example, in Formula 1 you need to worry about next year’s car. So, while\n",
    "you’re working on updating this year’s car, you also need to think about\n",
    "what will happen for next year and prioritize these conflicting needs\n",

    "Those decisions are being made on short time schedules; purchases are\n",

    "> \\[I\\]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices,\n",
    "> and I know that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast\n",

    "> future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, ‘Jeff I\n",
    "> love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,’ \\[or\\] ‘I\n",
    "> love Amazon; I just wish you’d deliver a little more slowly.’\n",
    "> Impossible. And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those\n",
    "> things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be\n",
    "> paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you\n",

    "> afford to put a lot of energy into it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This quote is incredibly important for long term thinking. Indeed, it’s\n",
    "a failure of many of our simulations that they focus on what is going to\n",
    "happen, not what will not happen. In Amazon, this meant that there was\n",
    "constant focus on these three areas, keeping costs low, making delivery\n",

They make joints that fuse PTFE pipes together. These pipes are used for transporting both water and gas. Their founder, Eric Bridgstock, was an engineer who introduced PTFE piping to the UK when working for DuPont. Eric set up Fusion group to manufacture the fusion fittings. Because PTFE pipes carry water or gas at high pressure, when these fittings fail significant damage can occur. When these fittings were originally installed in the early 1980s, the job was done by a specialist, but nowadays the pipe weld is compelted by the same team that digs the hole.

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We summarized the different types of simulation into roughly three\n",
    "groups. Firstly, those based on physical laws in the form of\n",
    "differential equations. Examples include certain compartmental\n",
    "epidemiological models, climate models and weather models. Secondly,\n",
    "discrete event simulations. These simulations often run to a ‘clock’,\n",
    "where updates to the state are taken in turns. The Game of Life is an\n",
    "example of this type of simulation, and Formula 1 models of race\n",
    "strategy also use this approach. There is another type of discrete event\n",
    "simulation that doesn’t use a turn-based approach but waits for the next\n",
    "event. The [Gillespie\n",
    "algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) is an\n",
    "example of such an approach but we didn’t cover it here. Finally, we\n",
    "realized that general computer code bases are also simulations. If a\n",
    "company has a large body of code, and particularly if it’s hosted within\n",
    "a streaming environment (such as Apache Kafka), it’s possible to back\n",
    "test the code with different inputs. Such backtests can be viewed as\n",
    "simulations, and in the case of large bodies of code (such as the code\n",
    "that manages Amazon’s automated buying systems) the back tests can be\n",
    "slow and could also benefit from emulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve introduced emulation as a way of dealing with different fidelities\n",
    "of simulations and removing the computational demands that come with\n",
    "them. We’ve highlighted how emulation can be deployed and introduced the\n",
