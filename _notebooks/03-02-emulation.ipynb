    "race simulation will look at the lap speed of each car and the top speed\n",
    "of each car (as measured in ‘speed traps’ that are placed on the\n",

    "a function of these values. Of course, underlying that function is the\n",
    "physics of how cars overtake each other, but that can be abstracted away\n",
    "into a simpler function that the Race Strategy Engineer defines from\n",
    "their knowledge and previous experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many simulations have this characteristic: major parts of the simulation\n",
    "are the result of encoding expert knowledge in the code. But this can\n",

    "a new simulation, how it was going. He replied that things had started\n",

    "for a while and over time a challenge of mis-specified granularity\n",

    "would have made that car difficult to overtake. However, the driver of\n",
    "that slower car was also in the team’s ‘development program’, so\n",
    "everyone in the team knew that the slower car would have moved aside to\n",
    "let their driver through. Unfortunately, the simulation didn’t know\n",
    "this. So, the team felt the wrong stategy decision was made. After the\n",
    "race, the simulation was updated to include a special case for this\n",

    "Over time there were a number of similar changes, each of which should\n",
    "have improved the simulation, but the reality was the code was now\n",
    "‘mixing granularities’. The formula for computing the probability of\n",
    "overtake as a function of speeds is one that is relatively easy to\n",
    "verify. It ignores the relationships between drivers, whether a given\n",
    "driver is a development driver, whether one bears a grudge or not,\n",
    "whether one is fighting for their place in the team. That’s all\n",

    "dependent on the question being asked of it. On the context. For\n",
    "example, in Formula 1 races you can also simulate the performance of the\n",
    "car in the wind tunnel and using computational fluid dynamics\n",

    "The same team also uses highly detailed aerodynamics simulations with\n",
    "computational fluid dynamics for car design. This different fidelity is\n",

    "Within any simulation, we can roughly split the variables of interest\n",
    "into the state variables and the parameters. In the Herd immunity\n",
    "example, the state variables were the different susceptible, exposed,\n",
    "infectious and recovered groups. The parameters were the reproduction\n",
    "number and the expected lengths of infection and the timing of lockdown.\n",
    "Often parameters are viewed as the inputs to the simulation, the things\n",
    "we can control. We might want to know how to time lock down to minimize\n",
    "the number of deaths. This behavior of the simulator is what we may want\n",
    "to emulate with our Gaussian process model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve introduced simulation motivated by the physical laws of\n",

    "equations, in which case we can try to solve those systems (like with\n",
    "Herd Immunity or Navier Stokes). An alternative approach is taken in the\n",
    "Game of Life. There a turn-based simulation is used, at each turn, we\n",
    "iterate through the simulation updating the state of the simulation.\n",
    "This is known as a *discrete event simulation*. In race simulation for\n",
    "Formula 1 a discrete event simulation is also used. There is another\n",
    "form of discrete event simulation, often used in chemical models, where\n",
    "the events don’t take place at regular intervals. Instead, the timing to\n",

    "\n",
    "We summarized the different types of simulation into roughly three\n",
    "groups. Firstly, those based on physical laws in the form of\n",
    "differential equations. Examples include certain compartmental\n",
    "epidemiological models, climate models and weather models. Secondly,\n",
    "discrete event simulations. These simulations often run to a ‘clock’,\n",
    "where updates to the state are taken in turns. The Game of Life is an\n",
    "example of this type of simulation, and Formula 1 models of race\n",
    "strategy also use this approach. There is another type of discrete event\n",
    "simulation that doesn’t use a turn-based approach but waits for the next\n",
    "event. The [Gillespie\n",
    "algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) is an\n",
    "example of such an approach but we didn’t cover it here. Finally, we\n",
    "realized that general computer code bases are also simulations. If a\n",
    "company has a large body of code, and particularly if it’s hosted within\n",
    "a streaming environment (such as Apache Kafka), it’s possible to back\n",
    "test the code with different inputs. Such backtests can be viewed as\n",
    "simulations, and in the case of large bodies of code (such as the code\n",
    "that manages Amazon’s automated buying systems) the back tests can be\n",
    "slow and could also benefit from emulation.\n",
