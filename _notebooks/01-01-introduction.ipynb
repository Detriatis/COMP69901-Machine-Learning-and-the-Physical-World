    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introduction to the course, we’ve provided a potted journey\n",
    "through the history of science and our models of the physical world. We\n",
    "started with the deterministic world of Newton and moved towards a less\n",
    "certain, stochastic world, beautifully described by Laplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within statistical mechanics and electrical engineering, the ideas of\n",
    "Laplace were rendered into mathematical reality. In particular, through\n",
    "the use of probabilistic processes such as Gaussian processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge we face is one of partial ignorance. Not the total\n",
    "ignorance of Maxwell/Gibbs/Boltzmann or the determinism of Newton. But\n",
    "something in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, that ignorance won’t only arise from lack of\n",
    "observation, but also from the need to run a (potentially) expensive\n",
    "simulation. Our aim will be to introduce you to the ideas of surrogate\n",
    "modeling, that allow us to trade off our current knowledge, with our\n",
    "possible knowledge, where data can be acquired through observation or\n",
    "simulation to render an answer to a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next set of lectures, you will obtain a more rigorous grounding\n",
    "in uncertainty and the mathematics and creation of Gaussian process\n",
    "models. We will then use these tools to show how a range of decisions\n",
    "can be made through combination of these surrogate models with\n",
    "simulations."
