    "    ## Types of Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "    We've introduced simulations from the perspective of laws of physics. In\n",
    "    practice, many simulations may not directly encode for the laws of\n",
    "    physics, but they might encode expert intuitions about a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, in Formula 1 races, the cars have tyres that wear at\n",
    "    different rates. Softer tyres allow the cars to drive faster, but wear\n",
    "    quicker. Harder tyres man the car drives slower but they last longer.\n",
    "    Changing between tyres is part of the race, and it has a time penalty.\n",
    "    Before each race the teams decide what their strategy will be with tyre\n",
    "    changes. It's not only how many tyre changes that are important, but\n",
    "    when they happen. If you change your tyre early, you might get a speed\n",
    "    advantage and be able to pass your rival when they change their tyre\n",
    "    later. This is a trick known as 'undercutting', but if your early change\n",
    "    puts you back onto the track behind other slower cars, you will loose\n",
    "    this advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Formula 1 teams determine their strategy through simulating the race.\n",
    "    Each team knows how fast other teams are around the track, and what\n",
    "    their top speeds are. So the teams simulate many thousands or millions\n",
    "    of races with different strategies for their rivals, and they choose the\n",
    "    strategy for which they maximize their number of expected points.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When many simulations are done, the results take time to come. During\n",
    "    the actual race, the simulations are too slow to provide the real time\n",
    "    information teams would need. In this case F1 teams can use emulators,\n",
    "    models that have learnt the effect of the simulations, to give real time\n",
    "    updates\n",
    "\n",
    "    Formula 1 race simulations contain assumptions that derive from physics\n",
    "    but don't directly encode the physical laws. For example, if one car is\n",
    "    stuck behind another, in any given lap, it might overtake. A typical\n",
    "    race simulation will look at the lap speed of each car and the top speed\n",
    "    of each car (as measured in 'speed traps' that are placed on the\n",
    "    straight). It will assume a probability of overtake for each lap that is\n",
    "    a function of these values. Of course, underlying that function is the\n",
    "    physics of how cars overtake each other, but that can be abstracted away\n",
    "    into a simpler function that the Race Strategy Engineer defines from\n",
    "    their knowledge and previous experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Many simulations have this characteristic: major parts of the simulation\n",
    "    are the result of encoding expert knowledge in the code. But this can\n",
    "    lead to challenges. I once asked a strategy engineer, who had completed\n",
    "    a new simulation, how it was going. He replied that things had started\n",
    "    out well, but over time its performance was degrading. We discussed this\n",
    "    for a while and over time a challenge of misspecified granularity\n",
    "    emerged.\n",
    "    :::\n",
    "\n",
    "    ::: {.cell .markdown}\n",
    "    ## Fidelity of the Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "    The engineer explained how there'd been a race where the simulation had\n",
    "    suggested that their main driver *shouldn't* pit because he would have\n",
    "    emerged behind a car with a slower lap speed, but a high top speed. This\n",
    "    would have made that car difficult to overtake. However, the driver of\n",
    "    that slower car was also in the team's 'development program', so every\n",
    "    one in the team knew that the slower car would have moved aside to let\n",
    "    their driver through. Unfortunately, the simulation didn't know this. So\n",
    "    the team felt the wrong stategy decision was made. After the race, the\n",
    "    simulation was updated to include a special case for this situation. The\n",
    "    new code checked whether the slower car was a development driver, making\n",
    "    it 'more realistic'.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Over time there were a number of similar changes, each of which should\n",
    "    have improved the simulation, but the reality was the code was now\n",
    "    'mixing granularities'. The formula for computing the probability of\n",
    "    over take as a function of speeds is one that is relatively easy to\n",
    "    verify. It ignores the relationships between drivers, whether or not a\n",
    "    given driver is a development driver, whether one bears a grudge or not,\n",
    "    whether one is fighting for their place in the team. That's all\n",
    "    assimilated into the equation. The original equation is easy to\n",
    "    calibrate, but as soon as you move to a finer granularity and consider\n",
    "    more details about indvidual drivers, the model seems more realistic but\n",
    "    it becomes difficult to specify, and therefore performance degrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Simulations work at different fidelities, but as the Formula 1 example\n",
    "    shows you have to be very careful about mixing fidelities within the\n",
    "    same simulation. The appropriate fidelity of a simulation is strongly\n",
    "    dependent on the question being asked of it. On the context. For\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "==========\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve introduced the notion of a simulator. A body of computer code that\n",
    "expresses our understanding of a particular physical system. We\n",
    "introduced such simulators through *physical laws*, such as laws of\n",
    "gravitation or electro-magnetism. But we soon saw that in may\n",
    "simulations those laws become abstracted and the simulation becomes more\n",
    "phenomological.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even full knowledge of all laws does not give us access to ‘the mind of\n",
    "God’, because we are lacking information about the data, and we are\n",
    "missing the compute. These challenges further motivate the need for\n",
    "abstraction, and we’ve seen examples of where such abstractions are used\n",
    "in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also summarized the different types of simmulation into roughly three\n",
    "groups. Firstly, those based on physical laws in the form of\n",
    "differential equations. Examples include certain compartmental\n",
    "epidemiological models, climate models and weather models. Secondly,\n",
    "discrete event simulations. These simulations often run to a ‘clock’,\n",
    "where updates to the state are taken in turns. The Game of Life is an\n",
    "example of this type of simulation, and Formula 1 models of race\n",
    "strategy also use this approach. There is another type of discrete event\n",
    "simulation that doesn’t use a turn based approach, but waits for the\n",
    "next event. The [Gillespie\n",
    "algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) is an\n",
    "example of such an approach but we didn’t cover it here. Finally, we\n",
    "realised that general computer code bases are also simulations. If a\n",
    "company has a large body of code, and particularly if it’s hosted within\n",
    "a streaming environment (such as Apache Kafka), it’s possible to back\n",
    "test the code with different inputs. Such backtests can be viewed as\n",
    "simulations, and in the case of large bodies of code (such as the code\n",
    "that manages Amazon’s automated buying systems) the back tests can be\n",
    "slow and could also benefit from automation."
