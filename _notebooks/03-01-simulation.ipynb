    "Probabilistic programming is an idea that, from our perspective, can be\n",
    "summarized as follows. What if, when constructing your simulator, or\n",
    "your model, you used a programming language that was aware of the state\n",
    "variables and the probability distributions. What if this language could\n",
    "‘compile’ the program into code that would automatically compute the\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the objective of probabilistic programming. The idea is that you\n",

    "We’ve introduced the notion of a simulator. A body of computer code that\n",

    "introduced such simulators through *physical laws*, such as laws of\n",

    "simulations those laws become abstracted, and the simulation becomes\n",
    "more phenomological.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even full knowledge of all laws does not give us access to ‘the mind of\n",
    "God’, because we are lacking information about the data, and we are\n",
    "missing the compute. These challenges further motivate the need for\n",
