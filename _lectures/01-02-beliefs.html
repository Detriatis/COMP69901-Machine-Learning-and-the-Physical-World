title: "Quantification of Beliefs"
abstract: "<p>This lecture will provide the background in probability
theory that we will make use of during the coming weeks. For many of you
this will be things that you have seen before but we will try to provide
a slightly different semantic to the purely mathematical concepts that
we will use throughout the course.</p>"

<p>lecture aims to do a quick introduction to the main building blocks
of machine learning and make steps towards making the concepts
introduced in the first lecture more mathematically grounded. In
addition to the lecture notes there is also a worksheet that provides a
more step-by-step walkthrough of the material. You can download the
lecture slides <a
