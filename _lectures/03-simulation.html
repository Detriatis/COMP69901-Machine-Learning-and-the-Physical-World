<p>Last lecture Carl Henrik introduced you to some of the challenges of approximate inference. Including the problem of mathematical tractability. Before that he introduced you to a particular form of model, the Gaussian process.</p>
<h2 id="bayesian-inference-by-rejection-sampling">Bayesian Inference by Rejection Sampling</h2>

<p>One view of Bayesian inference is to assume we are given a mechanism for generating samples, where we assume that mechanism is representing on accurate view on the way we believe the world works.</p>
<p>This mechanism is known as our <em>prior</em> belief.</p>
<p>We combine our prior belief with our observations of the real world by discarding all those samples that are inconsistent with our prior. The <em>likelihood</em> defines mathematically what we mean by inconsistent with the prior. The higher the noise level in the likelihood, the looser the notion of consistent.</p>
<p>The samples that remain are considered to be samples from the <em>posterior</em>.</p>
<p>This approach to Bayesian inference is closely related to two sampling techniques known as <em>rejection sampling</em> and <em>importance sampling</em>. It is realized in practice in an approach known as <em>approximate Bayesian computation</em> (ABC) or likelihood-free inference.</p>
<p>In practice, the algorithm is often too slow to be practical, because most samples will be inconsistent with the data and as a result the mechanism has to be operated many times to obtain a few posterior samples.</p>
<p>However, in the Gaussian process case, when the likelihood also assumes Gaussian noise, we can operate this mechanism mathematically, and obtain the posterior density <em>analytically</em>. This is the benefit of Gaussian processes.</p>
<p>First we will load in two python functions for computing the covariance function.</p>
<p>Next we sample from a multivariate normal density (a multivariate Gaussian), using the covariance function as the covariance matrix.</p>

<p>Figure: One view of Bayesian inference is we have a machine for generating samples (the <em>prior</em>), and we discard all samples inconsistent with our data, leaving the samples of interest (the <em>posterior</em>). This is a rejection sampling view of Bayesian inference. The Gaussian process allows us to do this analytically by multiplying the <em>prior</em> by the <em>likelihood</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, Gaussian processes provide an example of a particular type of model. Or, scientifically, we can think of such a model as a mathematical representation of a hypothesis around data. The rejection sampling view of Bayesian inference can be seen as rejecting portions of that initial hypothesis that are inconsistent with the data. From a Popperian perspective, areas of the prior space are falsified by the data, leaving a posterior space that represents remaining plausible hypotheses.</p>
<p>The flaw with this point of view is that the initial hypothesis space was also restricted. It only contained functions where the instantiated points from the function are jointly Gaussian distributed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)">Planck space craft</a> was a European Space Agency space telescope that mapped the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from 2009 to 2013. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background">Cosmic Microwave Background</a> is the first observable echo we have of the big bang. It dates to approximately 400,000 years after the big bang, at the time the universe was approximately <span class="math inline">10<sup>8</sup></span> times smaller and the temperature of the Univers was high, around <span class="math inline">3 × 10<sup>8</sup></span> degrees Kelvin. The Universe was in the form of a hydrogen plasma. The echo we observe is the moment when the Universe was cool enough for Protons and electrons to combine to form hydrogen atoms. At this moment, the Universe became transparent for the first time, and photons could travel through space.</p>

<p>The objective of the Planck space craft was to measure the anisotropy and statistics of the Cosmic Microwave Background. This was important, because if the standard model of the Universe is correct the variations around the very high temperature of the Universe of the CMB should be distributed according to a Gaussian process.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Currently our best estimates show this to be the case <span class="citation" data-cites="Jaffe:cmb98 Pontzen-cmb10 Elsner-unbiased15 Elsner-unbiased16">(Jaffe et al. 1998; Pontzen and Peiris 2010; Elsner, Leistedt, and Peiris 2015, 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>To the high degree of precision that we could measure with the Planck space telescope, the CMB appears to be a Gaussian process. The parameters of its covariance function are given by the fundamental parameters of the universe, for example the amount of dark matter and matter in the universe</p>

<p>Now we design our Universe. It is parameterised according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model"><span class="math inline"><em>Λ</em></span>CDM model</a>. The variables are as follows. <code>H0</code> is the Hubble parameter (in Km/s/Mpc). The <code>ombh2</code> is Physical Baryon density parameter. The <code>omch2</code> is the physical dark matter density parameter. <code>mnu</code> is the sum of the neutrino masses (in electron Volts). <code>omk</code> is the <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></span> is the curvature parameter, which is here set to 0, tiving the minimal six parameter Lambda-CDM model. <code>tau</code> is the reionization optical depth.</p>
<p>Then we set <code>ns</code>, the “scalar spectral index”. This was estimated by Planck to be 0.96. Then there’s <code>r</code>, the ratio of the tensor power spectrum to scalar power spectrum. This has been estimated by Planck to be under 0.11. Here we set it to zero. These parameters are associated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_fluctuations">with inflation</a>.</p>

<p>Figure: What we observe today is some non-linear function of the cosmic microwave background.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can think of todays observed Universe, though, as a being a consequence of those temperature fluctuations in the CMB. Those fluctuations are only order <span class="math inline">10<sup>−</sup>6</span> of the scale of the overal temperature of the Universe. But minor fluctations in that density is what triggered the pattern of formation of the Galaxies and how stars formed and created the elements that are the building blocks of our Earth <span class="citation" data-cites="Vogelsberger-cosmological20">(Vogelsberger et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Those Cosmological simulations are based on a relatively simple set of ‘rules’ that stem from our understanding of natural laws. These ‘rules’ are mathematical abstractions of the physical world. Representations of behaviour in mathematical form that capture the interaction forces between particles. The grand aim of physics has been to unify these rules into a single unifying theory. Popular understanding of this quest developed as a result of Stephen Hawking’s book, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time">A Brief History of Time</a>”. The idea of these laws as ‘ultimate causes’ has given them a pseudo religious feel, see for example Paul Davies’s book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind_of_God">The Mind of God</a>” which comes from a quotation form Stephen Hawking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we do discover a theory of everything … it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason-for then we would truly know the mind of God</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking in <em>A Brief History of Time</em> 1988</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an entrancing quote, that seems to work well for selling books (A Brief History of Time sold over 10 million copies), but as Laplace has already pointed out to us, the Universe doesn’t work quite so simply as that. Commonly, God is thought to be omniscient, but having a grand unifying theory alone doesn’t give us omniscience.</p>
<p>Laplace’s demon still applies. Even if we had a grand unifying theory, which encoded “all the forces that set nature in motion” we have an amount of work left to do in any quest for ‘omniscience’.</p>
<p>We summarized this notion as <br /><span class="math display">$$
\text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}
$$</span><br /> As we pointed out, there is an irony in Laplace’s demon forming the cornerstone of a movement known as ‘determinism’, because Laplace wrote about this idea in an essay on probabilities. The more important quote in the essay was</p>
<p>The representation of ignorance through probability is the true message of Laplace, I refer to this message as “Laplace’s gremlin”, because it is the gremlin of uncertainty that interferes with the demon of determinism to mean that our predictions are not deterministic.</p>
<p>Our separation of the uncertainty into the data, the model and the computation gives us three domains in which our doubts can creep into our ability to predict. Over the last three lectures we’ve introduced some of the basic tools we can use to unpick this uncertainty. In particular, you’ve been introduced to, (or have yow reviewed) <em>Bayes’ rule</em>. The rule, which is a simple consequence of the product rule of probability, is the foundation of how we update our beliefs in the presence of new information.</p>
<p>Carl Henrik described how a prior probability <span class="math inline">$p(\parameterVector)$</span> represents our hypothesis about the way the world might behave. This can be combined with a <em>likelihood</em> through the process of multiplication. Correctly normalized, this gives an updated hypothesis that represents our <em>posterior</em> belief about the model in the light of the data.</p>
<p>There is a nice symmetry between this approach and how Karl Popper describes the process of scientific discovery. In conjectures and refutations, Popper describes the process of scientific discovery as involving hypothesis and experiment. In our description hypothesis maps onto the <em>model</em>. The model is an abstraction of the hypothesis, represented for example as a set of mathematical equations, a computational description or an analogous system (physical system). The data is the product of previous experiments, our readings, our observation of the world around us. We can combine these to make a prediction about what we might expect the future to hold. Popper’s view on the philosophy of science was that the prediction should be falsifiable.</p>
<p>We can see this process as a spiral driving forward, importantly Popper relates the relationship between hypothesis (model) and experiment (predictions) as akin to the relationship between the chicken and the egg. Which comes first? The answer is that they co-evolve together.</p>

<p>Figure: The sets of different models. There are all the models in the Universe we might like to work with. Then there are those models that are computable e.g. by a Turing machine. Then there are those which are analytical tractable. I.e. where the solution might be found analytically. Finally, there are Gaussian processes, where the joint distribution of the states in the model is Gaussian.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The approach we’ve taken to the model so far has been severely limiting. By constraining ourselves to models for which the mathematics of probability is tractable, we severely limit what we can say about the universe.</p>
<p>Although Bayes’ rule only implies multiplication of probabilities, to acquire theposterior we also need to normalize. Very often it is this normalization step that gets in the way. The normalization step involves integration over the updated hypothesis space, to ensure the updated posterior prediction is correct.</p>
<p>We can map the process of Bayesian inference onto the the <span class="math inline">model + data</span> perspective in the following way. We can see the model as the prior, the data as the likelihood and the prediction as the posterior<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>So, if we think of our model as incorporating what we know about the physical problem of interest (from Newton, or Bernoulli or Laplace or Einstein or whoever) and the data as being the observations (e.g. from Piazzi’s telescope or a particle accelerator) then we can make predictions about what we might expect to happen in the future by combining the two. It is <em>those</em> predictions that Popper sees as important in verifying the scientific theory (which is incorporated in the model).</p>
<p>But while Gaussian processes are highly flexible non-parametric function models, they are <em>not</em> going to be sufficient to capture the type of physical processes we might expect to encounter in the real world. To give a sense, let’s consider a few examples of the phenomena we might want to capture, either in the scientific world, or in real world decision making.</p>
<h1 id="precise-physical-laws">Precise Physical Laws</h1>
<p>We’ve already reviewed the importance of Newton’s laws in forging our view of science: we mentioned the influence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens">Christiaan Huygens’</a> work on collisions had on Daniel Bernoulli in forming the kinetic theory of gases. These ideas inform many of the physical models we have today around a number of natural phenomena. The MET Office super computer in Exeter spends its mornings computing the weather across the world, and in its afternoons it’s used for climate modelling. It uses the same set of principles that Newton and Bernoulli explored for gases. They are encoded in the Navier-Stokes equations. The rules that govern the flow of compressible and incompressible fluids. As well as predicting our weather, these equations are used in fluid dynamics models to understand the flight of aircraft, the driving characteristics of racing cars and the efficiency of gas turbine engines.</p>
<p>This broad class of physical models, or ‘natural laws’ is probably the closest to what Laplace was referring to in the Demon. The search for unifying physical laws that dictate everything we observe around us has gone on. Alongside Newton we must mention James Clerk Maxwell, who unified electricity and magnetism in one set of equations that were inspired by the work and ideas of Michael Faraday. And still today we look for unifying equations that bring together in a single mathematical model the ‘natural laws’ we observe. One equation that for Laplace would be “all forces that set nature in motion”. We can think of this as our first time of physical model, a ‘precise model’ of the known laws of our Universe, a model where we expect that the mapping from the mathematical abstraction to the physical reality is ‘exact.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Figure: A scale of different simulations we might be interested in when modelling the physical world. The scale is <span class="math inline">log<sub>10</sub></span> meters. The scale reflects something about the level of granularity where we might choose to know “all positions of all items of which nature is composed”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, even if such an equation were to exist, we would be unlikely to know “all positions of all items of which nature is composed”. A good example here is computational systems biology. In that domain we are interested in understanding the undelying function of the cell. These systems sit somewhere between the two extremes that Laplace described: “the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the smallest atom”.</p>
<p>When the smallest atom is considered, we need to introduce uncertainty. We again turn to a different work of Maxwell, building on Bernoulli’s kinetic theory of gases we end up with probabilities for representing the location of the ‘molecules of air’. Instead of a deterministic location for these particles we represent our belief about their location in a distribution.</p>
<p>Computational systems biology is a world of micro-machines, built of three dimensional foldings of strings of proteins. There are spindles (stators) and rotors (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_synthase">ATP Synthase</a>), there are small copying machines (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase">RNA Polymerase</a>) there are sequence to sequence translators (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome">Ribosomes</a>). The cells store information in DNA, but have an ecosystem of structures and messages being sent and built in proteins and RNA. Unpikcing these structures has been a major preoccupation of biology. That is knowing where the atoms of these molecules are in the structure, and how the parts of the structure move when these small micro-machines are carrying out their roles.</p>
<p>We understand most (if not all) of the physical laws that drive the movements of these molecules, but we don’t understand all the actions of the cell, nor can we intervene reliably to improve things. So even in the case where we have a good understanding of the physical laws, Laplace’s gremlin emerges in our knowledge of “the positions of all items of which nature is composed”.</p>
<h2 id="molecular-dynamics-simulations">Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h2>
<p>By understanding and simulating the physics, we can recreate operations that are happening at the level of proteins in the human cell. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-ATPase">V-ATPase</a> is an enzyme that pumps protons. But at the microscopic level it’s a small machine. produces ATP in response to a proton gradient. A recent paper in Science Advanes simulates the functioning of these proteins that operate across from The response to this is to use a mathematical model which (somewhat) abstracts the processes. You can also check this <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2020-10-07-first-detailed-look-how-molecular-ferris-wheel-delivers-protons-cellular-factories">blog post</a> from the paper’s press release.</p>

<p>Each of these simulations have the same property of being based on a set of (physical) rules about how particles interact. But one of the interesting characteristics of such systems is how the properties of the system are emergent as the dynamics are allowed to continue.</p>
<p>These properties cannot be predicted without running the physics, or the equivalently the equation. Computation is required. And often the amount of computation that is required is prohibitive.</p>
<h2 id="accelerate-programme">Accelerate Programme</h2>
<p>The Computer Lab is hosting a new initiative known as the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. The aim is to address scientific challenges, and accelerate the progress of research, through using tools in machine learning.</p>
<p>We now have four fellows appointed, each of whom works at the interface of machine learning and scientific discovery. They are using the ideas around machine learning modelling to drive their scientific research.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tonicbq/">Bingqing Cheng</a>, one of the Department’s new DECAF Fellows has used neural network accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to understand a new form of metallic hydrogen, likely to occur at the heart of stars <span class="citation" data-cites="Cheng-evidence20">(Cheng et al. 2020)</span>. The University’s <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/ai-shows-how-hydrogen-becomes-a-metal-inside-giant-planets">press release is here</a>.</p>
<p>On her website Bingqing quotes Paul Dirac.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty lies only in the fact that application of these laws leads to equations that are too complex to be solved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>..approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation.</p>
<p>— Paul Dirac (6 April 1929)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as Bingqing, we have appointed <a href="https://oatml.cs.ox.ac.uk/members/challenger_mishra/">Challenger Mishra</a>, a physicist interested in string theoryand quantising gravity. <a href="https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?SarahMorgan">Sarah Morgan</a> from the Brain Mapping Unit, who is focussed on predicting psychosis trajectories and <a href="https://b2du.github.io/">Bianca Dumitrascu</a> who focusses on the interface of machine learning and biology.</p>
<p>For those interested in Part III/MPhil projects, you can see their project suggestions on <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/teaching/masters/projects/suggestions">this page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="surrogate-models-and-emulators">Surrogate Models and Emulators</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways we can use machine learning to accelerate scientific discovery. But one way is to have the machine learning model learn the effect of the rules. Rather than worrying about the detail of the rules through coputing each step, we can have the machine learning model look to abstract the rules and capture emergent phenomena, just as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution captures the essence of the behaviour of the ideal gas.</p>
<p>In the papers listed above, neural networks are being used to speed up computations. In this course we’ve introduced Gaussian processes that will be used to speed up these computations. In both cases the ideas are similar. Rather than rerunning the simulation, we use data from the simulation to <em>fit</em> the neural network or the Gaussian process to the data.</p>
<p>We’ll see an example of how this is done in a moment, taken from a simple ride hailing simulator, but before we look at that, we’ll first consider why this might be a useful approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Horton Conway</a> was a mathematician who developed a game known as the Game of Life.</p>
<p>The Game of Life is played on a grid of squares, or pixels. Each pixel is either on or off. The game has no players, but a set of simple rules that are followed at each turn the rules are.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survival</strong> Every pixel surrounded by two or three other pixels survives for the next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Death</strong> Each pixel surrounded by four or more pixels dies from overpopulation. Likewise, every pixel next to one or no pixels at all dies from isolation.</li>
<li><strong>Birth</strong> Each square adjacent to exactly three pixels gives birth to a new pixel.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it. Those are the simple ‘physical laws’ for Conway’s game.</p>
<p>The game leads to patterns emerging, some of these patterns are static, but some oscilate, with varying periods. Others oscilalate, but when they complete their cycle they’ve translated to a new location, in other words they move. In Life the former are known as <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Oscillator">oscillators</a> and the latter as <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Spaceship">spaceships</a>.</p>

<h1 id="modelling-in-practice">Modelling in Practice</h1>
<p>As we’ve seen from the very simple rules in the Game of Life, emergent phenomena we might be interested in take computation power to discover, just as Laplace’s and Dirac’s quotes suggest. The objective in surrogate modelling is to harness machine learning models to learn those physical characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-simulations">Types of Simulations</h2>
<p>We’ve introduced simulations from the perspective of laws of physics. In practice, many simulations may not directly encode for the laws of physics, but they might encode expert intuitions about a problem.</p>
<p>For example, in Formula 1 races, the cars have tyres that wear at different rates. Softer tyres allow the cars to drive faster, but wear quicker. Harder tyres man the car drives slower but they last longer. Changing between tyres is part of the race, and it has a time penalty. Before each race the teams decide what their strategy will be with tyre changes. It’s not only how many tyre changes that are important, but when they happen. If you change your tyre early, you might get a speed advantage and be able to pass your rival when they change their tyre later. This is a trick known as ‘undercutting’, but if your early change puts you back onto the track behind other slower cars, you will loose this advantage.</p>
<p>Formula 1 teams determine their strategy through simulating the race. Each team knows how fast other teams are around the track, and what their top speeds are. So the teams simulate many thousands or millions of races with different strategies for their rivals, and they choose the strategy for which they maximize their number of expected points.</p>
<p>When many simulations are done, the results take time to come. During the actual race, the simulations are too slow to provide the real time information teams would need. In this case F1 teams can use emulators, models that have learnt the effect of the simulations, to give real time updates</p>
<p>Formula 1 race simulations contain assumptions that derive from physics but don’t directly encode the physical laws. For example, if one car is stuck behind another, in any given lap, it might overtake. A typical race simulation will look at the lap speed of each car and the top speed of each car (as measured in ‘speed traps’ that are placed on the straight). It will assume a probability of overtake for each lap that is a function of these values. Of course, underlying that function is the physics of how cars overtake each other, but that can be abstracted away into a simpler function that the Race Strategy Engineer defines from their knowledge and previous experience.</p>
<p>Many simulations have this characteristic: major parts of the simulation are the result of encoding expert knowledge in the code. But this can lead to challenges. I once asked a strategy engineer, who had completed a new simulation, how it was going. He replied that things had started out well, but over time its performance was degrading. We discussed this for a while and over time a challenge of misspecified granularity emerged.</p>
<h2 id="fidelity-of-the-simulation">Fidelity of the Simulation</h2>
<p>The engineer explained how there’d been a race where the simulation had suggested that their main driver <em>shouldn’t</em> pit because he would have emerged behind a car with a slower lap speed, but a high top speed. This would have made that car difficult to overtake. However, the driver of that slower car was also in the team’s ‘development program’, so every one in the team knew that the slower car would have moved aside to let their driver through. Unfortunately, the simulation didn’t know this. So the team felt the wrong stategy decision was made. After the race, the simulation was updated to include a special case for this situation. The new code checked whether the slower car was a development driver, making it ‘more realistic’.</p>
<p>Over time there were a number of similar changes, each of which should have improved the simulation, but the reality was the code was now ‘mixing granularities’. The formula for computing the probability of over take as a function of speeds is one that is relatively easy to verify. It ignores the relationships between drivers, whether or not a given driver is a development driver, whether one bears a grudge or not, whether one is fighting for their place in the team. That’s all assimilated into the equation. The original equation is easy to calibrate, but as soon as you move to a finer granularity and consider more details about indvidual drivers, the model seems more realistic but it becomes difficult to specify, and therefore performance degrades.</p>
<p>Simulations work at different fidelities, but as the Formula 1 example shows you have to be very careful about mixing fidelities within the same simulation. The appropriate fidelity of a simulation is strongly dependent on the question being asked of it. On the context. For example, in Formula 1 races you can also simulate the performance of the car in the wind tunnel and using computational fluid dynamics represenations of the Navier Stokes equations. That level of fidelity <em>is</em> appropriate when designing the aerodynamic components of the car, but inappropriate when building a strategy simulation.</p>

<h1 id="related-approaches">Related Approaches</h1>
<p>While this module is mainly focussing on emulation as a route to bringing machine learning closer to the physical world, I don’t want to give the impression that’s the only approach. In particular, it’s worth bearing in mind three important domains of machine learning (and statistics) that we also could have explored.</p>
<ul>
<li>Probabilistic Programming</li>
<li>Approximate Bayesian Computation</li>
<li>Causal inference</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these domains also brings a lot to the table in terms of understanding the physical world.</p>
<h2 id="probabilistic-programming">Probabilistic Programming</h2>
<p>Probabilistic programming is an idea that, from our perspective, can be summarized as follows. What if, when constructing your simulator, or your model, you used a programming language that was aware of the state variables and the probability distributions. What if this language could ‘compile’ the program into code that would automatically compute the Bayesian posterior for you?</p>
<p>This is the objective of probabilistic programming. The idea is that you write your model in a language, and that language is automatically converted into the different modelling codes you need to perform Bayesian inference.</p>
<p>The ideas for probabilistic programming originate in <a href="https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/">BUGS</a>. The software was developed at the MRC Biostatistics Unit here in Cambridge in the early 1990s, by amoung others, David Spiegelhalter. Carl Henrik covered in last week’s lecture some of the approaches for approximate inference. BUGS uses Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling, however, can be slow to converge when there are strong correlations in the posterior between variables.</p>
<p>The descendent of BUGS that is probably most similar in the spirit of its design is <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>. Stan came from researchers at Columbia University and makes use of a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo called the No-U-Turn sampler. It builds on automatic differentiation for the gradients it needs. It’s all written in C++ for speed, but has interfaces to Python, R, Julia, Matlab etc. Stan has been higly succesful during the Coronavirus pandemic, with a number of epidemiological simulations written in the language, for example see this <a href="https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/boarding_school_case_study.html">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Other probabilistic programming languages of interest include those that make use of variational approaches (such as <a href="https://pyro.ai/">pyro</a>) and allow use of neural network components.</p>
<h2 id="approximate-bayesian-computation">Approximate Bayesian Computation</h2>
<p>We reintroduced Gaussian processes at the start of this lecture by sampling from the Gaussian process and matching the samples to data, discarding those that were distant from our observations. This approach to Bayesian inference is the starting point for <em>approximate Bayesian computation</em> or ABC.</p>
<p>The idea is straightforward, if we can measure ‘closeness’ in some relevant fashion, then we can sample from our simulation, compare our samples to real world data through ‘closeness measure’ and eliminate samples that are distant from our data. Through appropriate choice of closeness measure, our samples can be viewed as coming from an approximate posterior.</p>
<p>My Sheffield colleague, Rich Wilkinson, was one of the pioneers of this approach during his PhD in the Statslab here in Cambridge. You can hear Rich talking about ABC at NeurIPS in 2013 here.</p>

<p>All of these approaches offer a lot of promise for developing machine learning at the interface with science, but covering each in detail would require four separate modules. We’ve chosen to focus on the emulation approach, for two princpal reasons. Firstly, it’s conceptual simplicity. Our aim is to replace all or part of our simulation with a machine learning model. Typically, we’re going to want uncertainties as part of that representation. That explains our focus on Gaussian process models. Secondly, the emulator method is flexible. Probabilistic programming requires that the simulator has been built in a particular way, otherwise we can’t compile the program. Finally, the emulation approach can be combined with any of the existing simulation approaches. For example, we might want to write our emulators as probabilistic programs. Or we might do causal analysis on our emulators, or we could speed up the simulation in ABC through emulation.</p>

<p>In many real world systems, decisions are made through simulating the environment. Simulations may operate at different granularities. For example, simulations are used in weather forecasts and climate forecasts. The UK Met office uses the same code for both, but operates climate simulations one at greater spatial and temporal resolutions.</p>

<p>A statistical emulator is a data-driven model that learns about the underlying simulation. Importantly, learns with uncertainty, so it ‘knows what it doesn’t know’. In practice, we can call the emulator in place of the simulator. If the emulator ‘doesn’t know’, it can call the simulator for the answer.</p>

<p>As well as reconstructing an individual simulator, the emulator can calibrate the simulation to the real world, by monitoring differences between the simulator and real data. This allows the emulator to characterise where the simulation can be relied on, i.e. we can validate the simulator.</p>
<p>Similarly, the emulator can adjudicate between simulations. This is known as <em>multi-fidelity emulation</em>. The emulator characterizes which emulations perform well where.</p>
<p>If all this modelling is done with judiscious handling of the uncertainty, the <em>computational doubt</em>, then the emulator can assist in desciding what experiment should be run next to aid a decision: should we run a simulator, in which case which one, or should we attempt to acquire data from a real world intervention.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Most of my understanding of this is taken from conversations with Kyle Cranmer, a physicist who makes extensive use of machine learning methods in his work. See e.g. <span class="citation" data-cites="Mishra-Sharma-semi-parametric20">Mishra-Sharma and Cranmer (2020)</span> from Kyle and Siddharth Mishra-Sharma. Of course, any errors in the above text are mine and do not stem from Kyle.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>We should be careful about such mappings, this is the one I prefer to think about because I try to think of my modelling assumptions as being stored in a probabilistic model, which I see as the prior distribution over what I expect the data to look like. In many domains of parametric modelling, however, the prior will be specified over the parameters of a model. In the Gaussian process formalism we’re using, this mapping is clearer though. The ‘prior’ is the Gaussian process prior over functions, the data is the relationship between those functions and observations we make. This mental model will also suit what follows in terms of our consideration of simulation. But it would likely confuse someone who had only come to Bayesian inference through parametric models such a neural networks. Note that even in such models, there will be a way of writing down the decomposition of the model that is akin to the above, but it might involve writing down intractable densities so it’s often avoided.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p>Unfortunately, I have to use the term ‘exact’ loosely here! For example, most of these laws treat space/time as a continuum. But in reality, it is quantised. The smallest length we can define is Planck length (<span class="math inline">1.61 × 10<sup> − 35</sup></span>), and the the smallest time is Planck time. So even in this exact world of Maxwell and Newton there is an abstraction or a discretisation.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
