title: "Sequential Decision Making Under Uncertainty: Bayesian
Optimisation"
abstract: "<p>In this lecture we will see the first example of surrogate
modelling. In specific we will extend the machine learning loop to also
include the data aquisition. We will the formulate a sequential decision
process where we aim to find the extremum of a explicitly unknown
function. In specific we will introduce the concept of Bayesian
optimisation which is the technique that underpins the exciting field
called Auto-ML.</p>"
