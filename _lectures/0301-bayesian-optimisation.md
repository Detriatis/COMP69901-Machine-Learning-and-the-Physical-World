  With this lecture the course will change direction slightly and we will make use of the modelling tools that we have looked at. We will look at how we can build surrogate models for a system and create a sequential decision strategy to optimise a system. We will introduce the concept of Bayesian optimisation which is the technique that underpins the exciting field called Auto-ML.
