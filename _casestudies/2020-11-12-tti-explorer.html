title: "Simulating Contact Tracing in the Pandemic: TTI Explorer"
venue: "Virtual (Zoom)"
abstract: "<p>COVID-19 pandemic has become the major influence on life
of billions of people. To control the spread of the disease countries
are trying various measures, and Testing, Tracing and Isolation (TTI) is
one of them. In this talk we are going to discuss TTI Explorer, an open
source simulation developed by Royal Society DELVE initiative in order
to estimate effectiveness and resource requirements of TTI deployment in
the UK. We will explain why TTI Explorer was developed, how does it work
and what questions it was able to answer. In the final part of the talk
we will build a couple of bridges back to the course, by discussing the
sensitivity analysis of existing results, and by suggesting a few
potential project ideas.</p>"
