  COVID-19 pandemic has become the major influence on life of billions of people. To control the spread of the disease countries are trying various measures, and Testing, Tracing and Isolation (TTI) is one of them. In this talk we are going to discuss TTI Explorer, an open source simulation developed by Royal Society DELVE initiative in order to estimate effectiveness and resource requirements of TTI deployment in the UK. We will explain why TTI Explorer was developed, how does it work and what questions it was able to answer. In the final part of the talk we will build a couple of bridges back to the course, by discussing the sensitivity analysis of existing results, and by suggesting a few potential project ideas.
